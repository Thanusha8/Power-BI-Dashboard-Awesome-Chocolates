## Project Objective
To analyze sales performance across products, regions, and sales teams to identify profitable opportunities and optimize business strategy.
## Questions (KPIs)
•	What is the Total Sales amount?
•	What are This Month's sales?
•	What is the Month-over-Month percentage change?
•	How many Total Boxes were sold?
•	How many Total Shipments were made?
•	What is the Total Cost incurred?
•	What is the Total Profit earned?
•	What is the Profit Percentage?

## Process
•	Imported and cleaned sales transaction data
•	Created calculated measures for all KPIs
•	Designed visualizations to track key metrics
•	Implemented interactive filters for data exploration

## Project Insight
•	Peanut Butter Cubes delivers 87% profit margin
•	Sales peak November-January (holiday season)
•	Kelci Walkden is top performer ($1.5M sales)
•	Some products like Baker's Choco Chips underperform (17% margin)

## Final Conclusion:
The dashboard reveals three key opportunities:
1.	Focus on high-margin products (Peanut Butter Cubes, Orange Choco)
2.	Leverage top performers' strategies across the team
3.	Optimize inventory and promotions for peak seasons
