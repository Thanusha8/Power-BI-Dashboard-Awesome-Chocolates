## Project Objective
To analyze sales performance across products, regions, and sales teams to identify profitable opportunities and optimize business strategy.
## Questions (KPIs)
1.	What is the Total Sales amount?
2.	What are This Month's sales?
3.	What is the Month-over-Month percentage change?
4.	How many Total Boxes were sold?
5.	How many Total Shipments were made?
6.	What is the Total Cost incurred?
7.	What is the Total Profit earned?
8.	What is the Profit Percentage?


## Process
•	Imported and cleaned sales transaction data
•	Created calculated measures for all KPIs
•	Designed visualizations to track key metrics
•	Implemented interactive filters for data exploration

## Project Insight
•	Peanut Butter Cubes delivers 87% profit margin
•	Sales peak November-January (holiday season)
•	Kelci Walkden is top performer ($1.5M sales)
•	Some products like Baker's Choco Chips underperform (17% margin)

## Final Conclusion:
The dashboard reveals three key opportunities:
1.	Focus on high-margin products (Peanut Butter Cubes, Orange Choco)
2.	Leverage top performers' strategies across the team
3.	Optimize inventory and promotions for peak seasons
